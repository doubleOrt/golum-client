You will have to edit some setup variables for sure, i think that most (if not all) of the things that need to be edited are located either in the 2 HTML files in `www/` or the JS files from the `www/js/` directory (i would say the most important of these setup variables is the variable that declares the path to the server from `www/js/generic_functions.js`).
